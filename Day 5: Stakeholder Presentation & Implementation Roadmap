# 📊 Day 5: Stakeholder Presentation & Implementation Roadmap

---

### Objective
To synthesize findings from Days 1-4 into an executive presentation and create an actionable implementation roadmap for reducing social media's negative impact on workplace productivity.

---

### Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop** (Presentation Mode & Executive Dashboard)
- **PowerPoint** (for formal presentations)
- **DAX** (for executive summary metrics)
- **Power BI Service** (for sharing and collaboration)

---

## Part 1: Executive Summary Dashboard

### 🎯 Key Findings (Consolidated)
1. **Core Problem:** Employees averaging 3+ hours of daily social media use show 28% lower productivity
2. **High-Risk Groups:** 
   - Marketing Department (47% burnout rate)
   - Gen Z Employees (4.1 avg. hours/day)
   - Hybrid Workers (15% higher usage)
3. **Financial Impact:** Estimated 18% productivity loss = $[CALCULATED] annual revenue impact

### 📈 Executive Dashboard Created

#### Page 1: Executive Overview
Business Impact Scorecard =
VAR ProductivityLoss = [Average Productivity] - [Productivity with High Usage]
VAR EstimatedCost = [ProductivityLoss] * [Average Salary] * [Number of Employees]
RETURN
ROUND(EstimatedCost / 1000, 0) & "K Annual Impact"

**Visuals:**
- KPI Cards: Financial Impact, Productivity Gap, Burnout Rate
- Waterfall Chart: Productivity loss attribution
- Gauge: Current vs. Target productivity

#### Page 2: Department Performance
- Ranking: Departments by productivity-social media ratio
- Heatmap: Burnout risk by department × age group
- Trend: 6-month productivity trend by team

#### Page 3: Intervention Simulation
- **What-If Slider:** "If we reduce social media by X%, productivity increases by Y%"
- **Cost-Benefit Matrix:** Intervention options vs. expected ROI
- **Timeline Gantt:** Implementation phases

## Part 3: Implementation Roadmap

### 🗓️ Phase 1: Quick Wins (Weeks 1-4)
Quick Wins Tracker =
CALCULATE(
COUNTROWS('Initiatives'),
'Initiatives'[Timeline] = "30 Days",
'Initiatives'[Status] = "Not Started"
)

**Actions:**
1. **Week 1:** Implement "Focus Hours" (10 AM-12 PM)
2. **Week 2:** Manager training on digital wellness signs
3. **Week 3:** Department-level baseline measurements
4. **Week 4:** First progress review with leadership

### 🗓️ Phase 2: Department Rollout (Months 2-3)

- Individual productivity tracking opt-in

### 🗓️ Phase 3: Cultural Integration (Months 4-6)
- Policy integration into employee handbook
- Leadership certification program
- Quarterly wellness check-ins

---

## Part 4: Success Metrics & Monitoring

### 📊 DAX Tracking Measures Created
Productivity Improvement % =
VAR Baseline = CALCULATE([Avg Productivity], DATEADD('Date'[Date], -30, DAY))
VAR Current = [Avg Productivity]
RETURN
DIVIDE(Current - Baseline, Baseline)

Social Media Reduction % =
VAR BaselineHours = CALCULATE([Avg Social Media Hours], ALL('Date'[Date]))
VAR CurrentHours = [Avg Social Media Hours]
RETURN
DIVIDE(BaselineHours - CurrentHours, BaselineHours)

ROI Calculation =
[Productivity Improvement Value] / [Intervention Cost]

### 📈 Monitoring Dashboard Features
- **Daily/Weekly/Monthly** view toggle
- **Department comparison** tracker
- **Alert system:** Flags when metrics fall below thresholds
- **Automated report:** Scheduled weekly email to stakeholders
